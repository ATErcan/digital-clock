# Digital Clock

A simple website that shows the current date, current time and the day.
All days have different gifs to display.
Background image changes every season.

I used HTML, CSS and Bootstrap for the layout. 
I used Javascript to get the dates and time.

## Appendix

I did my best to give the website a different style. But I'm not a graphic designer. So this is the best I can do for now.
